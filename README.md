## Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data to forecast revenue using time series analysis and machine learning techniques. The notebook processes order numbers, transaction data, and reported revenue to build predictive models for retail performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing Pipeline**:
  - Cleans and transforms raw order data
  - Handles time series irregularities
  - Enforces business logic (e.g., monotonically increasing order numbers)

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Creates daily order metrics (growth rates, volumes)
  - Calculates transaction KPIs (spend per order, user engagement)
  - Aggregates to quarterly reporting periods

- **Modeling**:
  - Random Forest regressor for revenue prediction
  - Time-based cross-validation
  - Performance metrics (R-squared, MAE, percentage error)

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.x
- Key Libraries:
  - Pandas (data manipulation)
  - NumPy (numerical operations)
  - Scikit-learn (machine learning pipeline)
  - Statsmodels (time series decomposition)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization)

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure data files are in the correct format (Excel with specific sheets)
   - Install required dependencies (`openpyxl`, `statsmodels`)

2. **Running the Analysis**:
   - Execute cells sequentially in the Jupyter notebook
   - Main sections:
     - Data loading and inspection
     - Cleaning and transformation
     - Feature engineering
     - Model training and evaluation

3. **Interpreting Results**:
   - View time series visualizations
   - Examine model performance metrics
   - Review quarterly prediction breakdowns

## Key Findings

- The processed data shows clear upward trends in order volumes
- Random Forest model achieves good predictive performance
- Model can forecast quarterly revenue within acceptable error margins

## Customization

To adapt for different datasets:
1. Modify the `load_data()` function for your file format
2. Adjust date ranges in the feature engineering section
3. Tune model hyperparameters in `build_model()`

## Dependencies

Listed in notebook:
```python
!pip install openpyxl
!pip install statsmodels
```
